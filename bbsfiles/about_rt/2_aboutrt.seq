  ™rETROTERM› IS A petscii TERMINAL, BORNFROM CODE FROM OUR PREVIOUS PROJECTS. iTWORKS ONLY AT 57600 BPS, AND HAS TWOMODES OF OPERATION. wHEN IN NORMAL MODE,rETROTERM CAN RECEIVE UP TO 3 CHARACTERSPER FRAME, AND SEND 1 CHARACTER. kEEP INMIND THAT A pal c64 GENERATES 50 FRAMESPER SECOND, WHILE AN ntsc c64 GENERATES60 FRAMES PER SECOND. rETROTERMSYNCHRONIZES THE COMMUNICATION WITH THEVIDEO GENERATION, SO THAT BOTH THERECEPTION AND THE TRANSMISSION AREPERFORMED WHILE THE vic IS DRAWING THEBOTTOM BORDER OF THE SCREEN, BEING ABLETO RECEIVE 3 (BYTES) X 50 (FRAMES) = 150BYTES PER SECOND ON pal MACHINES, AND 3(BYTES) X 60 (FRAMES) = 180 BYTES PERSECOND ON ntsc. sINCE 1 BYTE NEEDS 10BITS (START, BYTE, STOP), THIS ISEQUIVALENT TO 1500 BPS ON pal AND 1800BPS ON ntsc MACHINES.›  iN THE SAME WAY, IT SENDS 1 BYTE PERFRAME, THAT IS, 50 ON pal AND 60 ON ntscMACHINES, REACHING A SENDING SPEEDEQUIVALENT TO 500 BPS ON pal AND 600 BPSON ntsc. aLTHOUGH IT WOULD BE POSSIBLETO GET A HIGHER THROUGHPUT, WE CHOOSETHOSE VALUES BECAUSE THEY ARE SLIGHTLYHIGHER THAN 1200 BPS, WHICH IS ANACCEPTABLE SPEED TO NAVIGATE A TYPICALpetscii bbs.  tHE TURBO MODE IS WHAT SETS rETROTERMAPART FROM OTHER TERMINAL PROGRAMS,SINCE IT MAKES POSSIBLE TO REACH THEMAXIMUM POSSIBLE THROUGHPUT AT 57600BPS. wHILE IN THIS MODE THE SCREEN ISDISABLED, TO STOP ANY INTERFERENCE FROMTHE vic TO THE PROCESSOR, AND TO BE ABLETO DEDICATE 100% OF THE PROCESSOR TIMETO THE COMMUNICATION. iN THIS MODE IT'SPOSSIBLE TO TRANSFER 46K IN ABOUT 10SECONDS.›  bOTH THE SPEED AND THE PRECISION OFTHE RECEPTION ARE ACHIEVED THANKS TOCAREFUL TIMING OF THE rts SIGNAL.  iN ORDER TO CONTROL THOSE TRANSFERS,MODE CHANGES AND OTHER SPECIAL FEATURES,WE DESIGNED A SET OF COMMANDS THAT WECALL ™turbo56k›. tHESE COMMANDS ALLOW TOTHE SERVER TO ACTIVATE THE FASTTRANSFERS, TO CHANGE THE CURRENT VIDEOMODE, TO CONTROL THE MICROsINT SPEECHSYNTHEZISER, AND TO STREAM BOTH sid AND 4-BIT, 11 khZ, pcm AUDIO.       ™rETROTERM› IS A PROJECT OF         retrocomputacion.com:™PASTBYTES›..................iDEA AND cODE™dURANDAL›...................tESTING, cODE™eZEQUIEL fILGUEIRAS (cOMMO64)›....tESTING™tHIERRY64›........................tESTING™gABRIEL gARCIA›...................tESTING
