===============================================================================

-----------------
1-1 Introduction
-----------------
RetroBBS is a bulletin board system specifically developed to work in
conjunction with Turbo56K protocol capable terminals, such as Retroterm for the
Commodore 64.

RetroBBS is written in Python3 and uses several 3rd party modules to provide a
rich, multimedia online experience for 8 bit computers.

Even though this is the third rewrite of this script, it is still in an early
development stage, expect to find many bugs and ugly/non-pythonic code inside. 


--------------------------
1-2 The Turbo56K protocol
--------------------------
Turbo56K was created by Jorge Castillo as a simple protocol to provide high
speed file transfer functionality to his bitbanging 57600bps RS232 routine
for the C64.
Over time, the protocol has been extended to include 4-bit PCM audio streaming,
bitmap graphics transfer and display, SID music streaming and more.

RetroBBS will refuse incoming connections from non-Turbo56K compliant
terminals.


-------------
1-3 Features
-------------
RetroBBS is quite customizable and expandable already at this early stage. The
use of a configuration file (config.ini) and built-in file transfer, stream
and display functions permits building a custom set of menus and file
galleries.
In addition, the plug-in system allows the addition of extra functionality with
full support from the config file.

The BBS is multi-threaded and supports up to five simultaneous incoming 
connections.

Current built-in functions:

    - Program transfer: Send Commodore 64 .prg files to the computer memory at
      the correct memory address.

    - RAW file transfer: Send RAW file data directly to the computer, no
      processing is done to the input data.

    - Text file transfer: Process different text formats (ASCII or PETSCII) and
      send it to the computer in pages.

    - Image conversion and display: Supports conversion of GIF, PNG, JPG file
      formats to C64 HiRes or Multicolor, also supports Koala Painter, Advanced
      Art Studio and Art Studio native file formats.
      Images larger than 320x200 pixels are resized and cropped for best fit.
      This functionality can be used from plug-ins. 

    - PCM audio streaming: WAV and MP3 files are converted to 4-bit 11520Hz PCM
      audio streams on the fly. Metadata is supported and displayed.

    - SID music streaming: SID files are converted to a stream of SID register
      writes. Only SID tunes that play once per frame (1X speed) are supported.
      This function requires the existence of the SIDDump executable in the
      system path.

Current included plug-ins:

    - Astronomy Picture Of the Day (apod.py): Retrieves and display the text
      and picture from NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day.
    - IRC Client (irc_client.py): Basic and very experimental IRC client.
    - RSS feed reader (newsfeed.py): Retrieves the latest 10 entries from the
      specified RSS feed, upon user selection of the entry it scrapes the
      target web site for text and relevant picture.
    - Oneliner (oneliner.py): Permits for user generated messages of up to 39
      characters.
    - WebAudio streamer (webaudio.py): On the fly conversion and streaming of
      on-line audio sources (Shoutcast or YouTube)
    - Wikipedia (wiki.py): Search and display Wikipedia articles, displays
      relevant article image if found.
    - YouTube snapshot (youtube.py): Display a frame from the specified YouTube
      video. It grabs the latest frame if the video is a livestream, otherwise
      it grabs a random frame.


-----------------
1-4 Requirements
-----------------

Python modules:

  * librosa (might need to install llvm before)
  * audioread
  * soundfile
  * mutagen
  * numpy
  * opencv-python
  * pafy (For the YouTube plug-in)
    Due to the removal of dislikes count from YouTube videos, the current (as of this writting) release of pafy (0.5.5)
    crashes when trying to open a video.
    As a workaround, install the development version of pafy using the following command:
    (if you already have pafy installed you need to uninstall it first)
    pip install git+git://www.github.com/mps-youtube/pafy@110bf7c01dcf57ec4e6e327e0c7907a4099d6933
  
  * wikipedia and wikipedia-api (For the Wikipedia plug-in)
  * hitherdither (https://www.github.com/hbldh/hitherdither)
  * beautifulsoup4
  * feedparser (For the RSS feeds plug-in)
  * irc (For IRC client plug-in)

External software:

  * FFmpeg (for WebAudio plug-in)
  * SIDDump (for SID streaming): https://github.com/cadaver/siddump replace the
    makefile with the one included in /siddump and compile. If you're using
    Linux, remove the .exe extension and copy the executable to usr/bin. 


-----------------------
2-1 Configuration file
-----------------------

RetroBBS uses a file named config.ini located in the root install directory,
this file follows the standard INI format (accepts the extended value
interpolation method as used by the configparse Python module):

-------------------
3-1 Plug-In system
-------------------

RetroBBS implements a simple plug-in system, on startup the BBS will import all
python modules found in the <plugins> directory.

All plug-in modules should implement at least two functions:

  setup() : Calling this function returns a tuple consisting of the plug-in
            name in uppercase, which will be used as the callable function on
            the config file. And a list of parameters, each element being a
            tuple itself. This tuple is made of the parameter name to use in
            the config file and the corresponding default value in case the
            parameter is not found.
  
  plugfunction(conn, <extra parameters>) : This is the function that is called
            by the BBS to perform the plug-in's task.
            The first parameter <conn> is a Connection object (see Chapter 4)
            to which the plug-in should direct its output.
            Any extra parameters will follow, with the same names as returned
            by setup().

-------------------
4-1 Common modules
-------------------
Located inside the <common> directory you'll find modules which integrate what
could be called the BBS' API. The use of some of these modules is mandatory
when writing a new plug-in.

- common.bbsdebug: Log output to stdout, implements a single function:
    _LOG(message, _end='\n', date=True, id=0):
        Prints <message> on stdout. <message> can be any expression valid for
        the print function.
        The message will end in a newline by default, you change this by
        passing a different end string in the <_end> parameter.
        By default the message will be preceded by the current date and time,
        disable this by passing False in the <date> parameter.
        <id> Should be the connection id corresponding to this message.
        Defaults to 0 -> general message.

    Also defined in this module is the <bcolors> class, which enumerates a few
    ANSI codes for use in the log messages.

- common.c64cvt: Image conversion to raw C64 formats.
    c64imconvert(Source, gfxmode=1, dmode = 0):
        Converts PIL image object <Source> into C64 graphic data.
        <gfxmode> selects the C64 graphic mode to use:
                  0 = HiRes
                  1 = MultiColor (default)
        Returns a tuple (e_img,cells,screen,color,bg_color) where:
            <e_img>:  PIL image object, rendering of the converted image
            <cells>:  c64 bitmap data (8000 bytes)

                to find about the different class properties.
    RenderMenuTitle(conn,title): Sends the menu title header with text <title>
                to <conn>, using the default style. Client screen is cleared
                and charset is switched to lowercase. Text mode is not
                enforced, the caller must ensure that text mode or a text
                window is active on the client.
    KeyPrompt(text,style=default_style): Returns the key prompt string for
                <text>. The prompt takes the form [<text>] using the colors
                defined by <style>

- common.turbo56k: Defines the Turbo56K protocol constants and helper functions
                See turbo56k.txt for more information.

      use with the Connection.Sendall() or Connection.Sendallbin() methods.
      to_Text(page, border, background, bin = False): Switch the client screen
                to text mode.
                <page> is the text memory page to use
                <border> and <background> set the corresponding client screen
                colors
                <bin> selects the return string type
      to_Hires(page,border, bin = False): Switch the client screen to HiRes

                to <column>, <row> coordinates
                <bin> selects the return string type
      Fill_Line(row, char, bin= False): Fill the client screen <row> with
                <char> (in C64 screencode), fill color is the last used.
                <bin> selects the return string type
      enable_CRSR(bin = False): Enables the client text cursor.
                <bin> selects the return string type
      disable_CRSR(bin = False): Disables the client text cursor.
                <bin> selects the return string type
      split_Screen(line, multi, bgtop, bgbottom, bin = False): Splits the
                client screen into a bitmap top and a text bottom parts.
                <line> the text screen row on which the split occurs
                <multi> boolean, True for Multicolor mode on the top part,
                        False for HiRes
                <bgtop> Background color for the top part, only used when
                        Multicolor mode is selected
                <bgbottom> Background color for the bottom part
                <bin> selects the return string type
      set_Window(top, bottom,bin = False): Set the <top> and <bottom> limits
                for the client text output, this includes scrolling and screen
                clearing.
                <bin> selects the return string type

5-1 Installation/Usage
-----------------------
After making sure you have installed all the required python modules, and extra
software, just unpack this archive into a directory of your choice.
You can run this script from a command line by navigating to the Installation
directory and then issuing:

    python retrobbs.py

or

    python3 retrobbs.py

depending of your python install.

-----------------------------
5-2 The intro/login sequence
-----------------------------
Once a connection with a client is established, and the correct version of
retroterm is detected, the client will enter into split screen mode and display
the splash.art bitmap file found in the <bbsfiles> subdirectory.
The user will then be asked if he wants to view the intro sequence or skip it.
If the user choses to view the intro sequence then the files in the
subdirectory <bbsfiles/intro> will be shown/played in alphabetical order.

-------------------
5-3 SID SongLength
-------------------
Currently the SID streaming routines are only accessed from the AUDIOLIBRARY
internal function. This function will set the songlength by searching for the
.ssl files corresponding the the .sid files found, defaulting to 3 minutes if
not found.
The .ssl format is used by the songlength files part of the High Voltage SID
Collection (http//:hvsc.c64.com). But while the HVSC uses a 'SONGLENGTHS'
subdirectory to store the .ssl files, RetroBBS needs these files located in the
same directory than the .sid files.

---------------
6-1 TO-DO List
---------------

 * Further code cleanup, move more functions out of the main script and into
   their corresponding modules.
 * Add user login capability
 * Work towards user style customization
 * Selectable log verbosity levels
 * Subtune selection for SID Streaming

---------------
6-2 Known bugs
---------------

  * Config file parser doesnt check for errors, a badly built config.ini will
    cause a crash on startup.
