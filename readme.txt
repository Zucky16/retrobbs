1-1 Introduction
-----------------
RetroBBS is a bulletin board system specifically developed to work in
conjunction with Turbo56K protocol capable terminals, such as Retroterm for the
Commodore 64.

RetroBBS is written in Python3 and uses several 3rd party modules to provide a
rich, multimedia online experience for 8 bit computers.

Even though this is the third rewrite of this script, it is still in an early
development stage, expect to find many bugs and ugly/non-pythonic code inside. 


--------------------
1-2 Release history
--------------------

v0.10 (16/08/2021): Initial release

v0.20 (15/11/2022):
  New features:
  - Added Login/User functionality
  - Added userclass/userlevel settings for the config file, select which menu
    is accessible to admins/sysops, registered users and/or guests
  - Added a verbosity command line switch, see section 5-1
  - Added Turbo56K v0.6 support, terminal features are queried and displayed
    on connection.
  - Messaging system, supports public boards and private messages.
    Public boards can have independent Read/Post user class permissions.

  Changes/Bug fixes:
  - Improvements to c64cvt
  - Fixed problems retrieving YouTube videos metadata due to removal of
    dislikes count.
  - YouTube frame capture now is faster after the 1st frame.
  - Core PCM audio and SID file streaming functions moved to their own module.
  - All PCM audio decoding is done using FFmpeg
  - WebAudio plugin can share any given PCM stream between multiple clients.
  - Updated example config file with valid links to YouTube videos and
    RSS feeds.
  - Misc. code cleanup
  - AudioList now supports HVSC style path to songlength files
  - Now most text parameters other than in calls to the Connection class are
    expected to be ASCII, not PETSCII, this also counts for the config
    file

v0.2x (In development):
  New features:
  - ...

  Changes/Bug fixes:
  - Librosa module replaced by audioread and use of ffmpeg audio filters.
    PCM streaming no longers use mu-law compression.
  - Removed legacy raw audio streaming code.

--------------------------
1-3 The Turbo56K protocol
--------------------------
Turbo56K was created by Jorge Castillo as a simple protocol to provide high
speed file transfer functionality to his bitbanging 57600bps RS232 routine
for the C64.
Over time, the protocol has been extended to include 4-bit PCM audio streaming,
bitmap graphics transfer and display, SID music streaming and more.

RetroBBS will refuse incoming connections from non-Turbo56K compliant
terminals.


-------------
1-4 Features
-------------
RetroBBS is quite customizable and expandable already at this early stage. The
use of a configuration file (config.ini) and built-in file transfer, stream
and display functions permits building a custom set of menus and file
galleries.
In addition, the plug-in system allows the addition of extra functionality with
full support from the config file.

The BBS is multi-threaded and supports up to five simultaneous incoming 
connections.

Current built-in functions:

    - User signup and signin. Plain text JSON database, salted password storage

    - Public message boards and private messaging system
 
    - Program transfer: Send Commodore 64 .prg files to the computer memory at
      the correct memory address.

    - RAW file transfer: Send RAW file data directly to the computer, no
      processing is done to the input data.

    - Text file transfer: Process different text formats (ASCII or PETSCII) and
      send it to the computer in pages.

    - Image conversion and display: Supports conversion of GIF, PNG, JPG file
      formats to C64 HiRes or Multicolor, also supports Koala Painter, Advanced
      Art Studio and Art Studio native file formats.
      Images larger than 320x200 pixels are resized and cropped for best fit.
      This functionality can be used from plug-ins. 

    - PCM audio streaming: WAV and MP3 files are converted to 4-bit 11520Hz PCM
      audio streams on the fly. Metadata is supported and displayed.

    - SID music streaming: SID files are converted to a stream of SID register
      writes. Only SID tunes that play once per frame (1X speed) are supported.
      This function requires the existence of the SIDDump executable in the
      system path.

Current included plug-ins:

    - Astronomy Picture Of the Day (apod.py): Retrieves and display the text
      and picture from NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day.
    - IRC Client (irc_client.py): Basic and very experimental IRC client.
    - RSS feed reader (newsfeed.py): Retrieves the latest 10 entries from the
      specified RSS feed, upon user selection of the entry it scrapes the
      target web site for text and relevant picture.
    - Oneliner (oneliner.py): Permits for user generated messages of up to 39
      characters.
    - WebAudio streamer (webaudio.py): On the fly conversion and streaming of
      on-line audio sources (Shoutcast or YouTube)
    - Wikipedia (wiki.py): Search and display Wikipedia articles, displays
      relevant article image if found.
    - YouTube snapshot (youtube.py): Display a frame from the specified YouTube
      video. It grabs the latest frame if the video is a livestream, otherwise
      it grabs a random frame.

3-1 Plug-In system
-------------------

RetroBBS implements a simple plug-in system, on startup the BBS will import all
python modules found in the <plugins> directory.

All plug-in modules should implement at least two functions:

  setup() : Calling this function returns a tuple consisting of the plug-in
            name in uppercase, which will be used as the callable function on
            the config file. And a list of parameters, each element being a
            tuple itself. This tuple is made of the parameter name to use in
            the config file and the corresponding default value in case the
            parameter is not found.
  
  plugfunction(conn, <extra parameters>) : This is the function that is called
            by the BBS to perform the plug-in's task.
            The first parameter <conn> is a Connection object (see Chapter 4)
            to which the plug-in should direct its output.
            Any extra parameters will follow, with the same names as returned
            by setup().

-------------------
4-1 Common modules
-------------------
Located inside the <common> directory you'll find modules which integrate what
could be called the BBS' API. The use of some of these modules is mandatory
when writing a new plug-in.

- common.audio: Audio/SID streaming:
    AudioList(conn,title,speech,logtext,path):
        Creates and manages an PCM audio/SID file browser.
        <conn>: Connection object
        <title>: String to be used as title for the file browser
        <speech>: Optional string for the voice synthesizer
        <logtext>: String to output in the log
        <path>: Path to the directory to browse
    PlayAudio(conn,filename, length = 60.0, dialog=False):
        Converts and streams a PCM audio file to <conn>.
        <filename>: Path to the file to stream, file can be either 4-bit .RAW,
        or any audio fileformat supported by librosa
        <length>: Length of the audio to stream in seconds, RAW files are
        streamed in they interity
        <dialog>: Boolean, display audio metadata and instructions before
        starting streaming

        streaming

- common.bbsdebug: Log output to stdout:
    _LOG(message, _end='\n', date=True, id=0, v=1):
        Prints <message> on stdout. <message> can be any expression valid for
        the print function.
        The message will end in a newline by default, you change this by
        passing a different end string in the <_end> parameter.
        By default the message will be preceded by the current date and time,
        disable this by passing False in the <date> parameter.
        <id> Should be the connection id corresponding to this message.
        Defaults to 0 -> general message.
        <v> Verbosity level for this message. If greater than the level
        selected on startup the log message will not be printed.

    Also defined in this module is the <bcolors> class, which enumerates a few

                        If auto is True, the function will return automatically
                        if the user enters the maximun number of digits
                        possible within the limits, or by pressing DEL when
                        there's no digit entered. In which case this function
                        will return None.

                to <conn>, using the default style. Client screen is cleared
                and charset is switched to lowercase. Text mode is not
                enforced, the caller must ensure that text mode or a text
                window is active on the client.
    KeyPrompt(text,style=default_style): Returns the key prompt string for
                <text>. The prompt takes the form [<text>] using the colors

-----------------------
5-1 Installation/Usage
-----------------------
After making sure you have installed all the required python modules, and extra
software, just unpack this archive into a directory of your choice.
If you're upgrading a previous installation, make sure to not overwrite your
configuration files with the ones included as example.

  NOTICE: Starting at v0.20 all text parameters in the config file are expected
  to be encoded in ASCII, if you're updating from v0.10 remember to convert
  your PETSCII parameters.


You can run this script from a command line by navigating to the Installation
directory and then issuing:

    python retrobbs.py

or

    python3 retrobbs.py

depending of your python install.

The only available command line option right now is -v[1-4], which sets the
verbosity of the log messages, a value of 1 will only output error messages,
while a value of 4 will output every log line.

-----------------------------
5-2 The intro/login sequence
-----------------------------
Once a connection with a client is established, and a supported version of
retroterm is detected, the client will enter into split screen mode and display
the splash.art bitmap file found in the <bbsfiles> subdirectory.
The user will then be asked if he wants to view the intro sequence or skip it.
If the user choses to view the intro sequence then the files in the
subdirectory <bbsfiles/intro> will be shown/played in alphabetical order.

-------------------
5-3 SID SongLength
-------------------
Currently the SID streaming routines are only accessed from the AUDIOLIBRARY
internal function. This function will set the songlength by searching for the
.ssl files corresponding the the .sid files found, defaulting to 3 minutes if
not found.
The .ssl format is used by the songlength files part of the High Voltage SID
Collection (http//:hvsc.c64.com). HVSC uses a 'SONGLENGTHS' subdirectory to 
store the .ssl files, RetroBBS can also read these files in the same directory
where the .sid files are located.

----------------------------------------
5-4 User accounts / Database management
----------------------------------------
RetroBBS now supports the creation of user accounts, this allows for the
restriction of BBS areas according to user classes and the incorporation of the
messaging system.

TinyDB is used as the database backend. The database is a JSON file located in
the "bbsfiles" directory.

Upon registering the user will be shown the file rules.txt located in
"bbsfiles/terms", you should edit this file according to your needs.
When registering the user will be asked the following data:

  - Password (stored as a salted hash in the database)
  - First and last names
  - Country of origin
  - Date of birth (Date format is defined by the "dateformat" parameter in the
                   config file)

A registered user will have a userclass=1 by default. Unregistered users
(guests) have a userclass=0.
Admins/Sysops are those with a userclass=10.

You can use userclasses 2 to 9 for more access granurality as you see fit.

A separate script for database management is included in the form of
dbmaintenance.py
Run it by issuing the following command (while the BBS is not running):

  python dbmaintenance.py

With this script you can:

  * Edit user data, and change their userclass.
  * Delete users
  * Add users

The script will also do a quick integrity check on the database file.

IMPORTANT: When setting up a new BBS (or upgrading from v0.10) use
dbmaintenance.py to create your account and set your class as 10 to assign
yourself as admin/sysop.

---------------------
5-5 Messaging system
---------------------
The messaging system permits unlimited public or semipublic boards plus a
personal messages board for each registered user.

At the time of writing, this early implementation supports messages of up to
720 characters in length, organized in 18 rows of 40 columns each.
The message editor works on per line basis, a line being completed by pressing
<RETURN>, passing the 40 characters limit, or selecting another line to edit
(by pressing <F3>).
On entering the editor, if the user is starting a new message thread they will
be asked to first enter a topic for the thread.
Once done with the editing the user should press <F8> and will be prompted if
they want to continue editing, send the message, or cancel the message.

An user with admin/sysop userclass (10) can delete threads or individual
messages (deleting the first message in a thread will delete the whole thread).

---------------
6-1 TO-DO List
---------------

 * Further code cleanup, move more functions out of the main script and into
   their corresponding modules.
 * Work towards user style customization
 * Subtune selection for SID Streaming
 * Localization

----------------------
6-2 Known bugs/issues
----------------------

  * Config file parser doesnt check for errors, a badly built config.ini will
    cause a crash on startup.
  * If updating from v0.10, the messages already existing in the oneliners.json
    file will have the wrong encoding. New messages will display correctly.
